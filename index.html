    <p>Hi! I’m Alyssa Ramos, a 33-year old self-made, Cuban American, solo travel blogger and social media influencer, who fled societal norms (literally) 8 years ago and have been traveling the world ver since!I’m an adventure junkie, and I tend to opt for challenges and pushing limits, especially if people don’t think I can do them! I suppose you could say my niche is “solo female adventure travel” but that sounds extremely tame considering the type of stunts I usually pull. So far, I have been to 85+ countries and 7 continents, and my top favorite places have been Antarctica, Iceland, Japan, Svalbard, India and the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil!</p>
    <p>Now, I’m still flabbergasted to say that I actually do get paid to travel. I worked hard to reach my dream, I still work my ass off to continue to be great at what I do, and I’ve basically dedicated my life to the people like you who I want to inspire and motivate through travel and fearlessly going after your dreams!</p>
    <p>I aim to inspire others to travel, whether it’s by providing information and travel tips, or showcasing a destination through my photography (a skill I learned through traveling!). If you like my blog and have found it useful, please consider signing up for my newsletter, spreading the word, and following along on my social media accounts. It’s because of you that I’m able to keep this thing going!</p>
    <h1><b>How I Got Started Travel Blogging</b></h1>
    <p>Travel blogging isn’t a job you can just apply for. And I’m not “lucky” that I have “the dream job”. I spent countless hours working low-paying freelance writing gigs just to support myself while building up my blog, and now I spend about 15 hours a day solely working on my blog and social media. I paid for all of my first initial trips after saving for over a year, then kept writing and reaching out to people for opportunities until finally I traveled and wrote enough to find a niche and grow an audience, and make a name for myself in the travel blogging world.</p>
    <p>In all honesty, I thought making money from blogging would come a lot quicker than it did following the Huff Post article, which is why I dropped every other freelance job I had to only work on my blog, and used the little money I had that my grandfather had left me to get a one bedroom apartment that I could rent out on AirBnB in order to make money while I was traveling.</p>
    <h1><b>Hitting Rock Bottom and How I Overcame It</b></h1>
    <p>I was struggling so bad for money that I would take road trips and go camping, just so that I could make money renting my apartment out! I kept going though, and even ended up maxing out my first credit card so that I could continue to travel and have content to post.</p>
    <p>In February of 2016, I had to give up my AirBnB apartment because it was costing me more than I was making. I was at a major low point and had no idea what to do next. I knew traveling would be cheaper than getting another apartment (because of the deposit mostly), so I took a 2-month sublet with plans to travel for the month of May, and worked non-stop every hour of every day for two months on my SEO, social media, and any contributing articles and websites I could get paid to write for.</p>
    <h1><b>How I Became a Full-Time Travel Blogger</b></h1>
    <p>In May of 2016, I was able to fully fund my travels through collaborations, and paid posts on my blog and social media. That being said, it took one year of part-time blogging, and ten months of full-time non-paid blogging, to finally become a full-time profiting travel blogger.</p>
    <P>Before being a full time travel blogger, I went to college for pre-veterinary (I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Florida State University), I was a veterinary technician in Florida, quit and started planning charity events, then accidentally moved to LA where I discovered the amazing world of freelance writing and journalism. After realizing that writing and traveling were my two true passions, I figured out how to combine them and thus began my attempt to start a career in travel blogging.</P>
    <h1><b>Why I Travel Solo</b></h1>
    <p>Although now solo travel is insanely popular, when I first started doing it, it wasn’t. I took my first solo trip because I kept waiting around for other people to travel with, which made me miss a lot of opportunities. After my first solo trip though, I realized how much I loved not having to worry about someone else’s schedule or behavior.</p>
    <P>I mostly prefer traveling solo because I’m an ambitious adventurer and I like to do a lot of aggressive traveling at random which makes it hard to coordinate with someone else. When I travel, I also work a lot which is difficult to do with someone else, and also as an “outgoing introvert,” I find it easier to meet people when I’m on my own.</P>

        <h1><b>How I Can Afford to Travel</b></h1>
    <p>I started out making money as an online freelance writer/PR/Marketing/Social Media specialist. I used that money to live, and saved the rest to travel in order to gain content for my blog. I used to make some money from writing travel articles for various sites, including Matador Network, Geo Chic Magazine, and The Huffington Post (but I got paid in publicity…) but that was never really substantial. When I was still building my blog, I also had the genius idea to fix up an apartment and AirBnB it out, which worked for a while, and forced me to travel, but in the long run, I was only breaking even with rent, so I gave it all up, put my stuff in storage, and left to go travel full-time using free collaborations and staying in cheap countries.</p>
        <h1><b>Why I Do It</b></h1>
        <p>Obviously I love traveling, otherwise this job would be bad.But what I also love is helping and inspiring other people as well, and proving that if you work hard enough at something, you can achieve it.</p>
        <h1><b>Giving Back</b></h1>
        <p>When I first started blogging, I had no idea what I was doing, and no one would help me. No one taught me how to travel, or told me it was possible to save and make money to do it, or that I wasn’t crazy for wanting to go travel solo just so I could see the world. That’s why now, I want to help people who feel what I initially felt, so I’ve started a program called The Wanderlust Workers, which is a travel savings and makings program for people who are willing to work hard to travel.</p>
        <P>Happy and Safe Travels!</P>
